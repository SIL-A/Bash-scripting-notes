+ The command `cat > '<filename>'` can be used to change the terminal into an editor without using any other editors like vim or nano. If the file with the given name does not exist, a new one is created. To save and exit the "EDITOR", you need to press `ctr+d` .
+ In bash, variables are declared like in python without specifying their datatypes. While calling them, we need to use the `$` symbol to let the shell know that it is an already declared variable
+ In Unix, a single set of square brackets `[]` is a synonym for the `test` command. 
+ In line 3 of the code in [[Conditional statements]], the word `count` is a variable. In bash scripting, remember that you should not leave any spaces between the variable and its assiged value. For example, `count = 100` will print out an error while `count=100` will not.
+ In [[Loops]], you can see the line `count=$(( count + 1 ))`. Here the variable `count` is being appended by 1. The intersting thing is that the angular brackets ('' `(( ))`'') are used to denote that the variable is being incremented. When the brackets are removed, like `count=$count+1`, the shell consideres the variable type to be string and presents appends the `+1` the the variable `count`. So in the code in [[Loops]], the output would be:
	```
	1
	1+1
	1+1+1
	1+1+1+1
	1+1+1+1+1
	1+1+1+1+1+1
	1+1+1+1+1+1+1
	1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1
	1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1
	```

+ In [[Loops]] again, the flower brackets the `{0..10}` means that the values are from 0 to 10. 
+ In [[Standard output and Standard error]], if we use the code `<command to execute> >& <file name>`, then both the error and the correct output will be saved in the file.
